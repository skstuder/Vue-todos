# About This Project

This project was my first ever vue project, initally it started as the result of following a tutorial. I have used this repo to experiment/refactor on a smaller scale before larger scale assignments at work. I consider this project one of my small breakable toy's .

## First Refactor in 2019
- Converted it to use vuetify, framework used by employer at the time
- Added transitions
- Added vue router
- Added axios to make requests to public api's
- Changed from a copy of a tutorial to something that had my unique style
- Deployed to netlify (still deployed in old version: https://stephen-vue-todos.netlify.app/#/)

## Second refactor in 2022
- Removed Vuetify and added my own custom classless css library called OliverCSS
- Converted from webpack to vite
- Converted from vue 2 to vue 3
- Upgraded Vue router to V4
- Upgraded all packages that were not vue 3 compatible
- Removed all security vulnerabilites, 50 total
- Changed from Netlify to Vercel
